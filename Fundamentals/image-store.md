### Where does Docker store its images?
Normally under "/var/lib/docker" directory, but the contents very depending on
the driver Docker is using. You can check the driver by the following command:
```bash
$ docker info
Containers: 32
 Running: 30
 Paused: 0
 Stopped: 2
Images: 41
Server Version: 17.06.1-ce
Storage Driver: overlay
 Backing Filesystem: extfs
 Supports d_type: true
```

In my case, I use the "overlay" driver.

### How the "overlay" driver works
Overlay FS layers two directories on a single Linux host and presents them as a
single directory. These directories are called layers and the unification
process is referred to a "union mount". Overlay FS refers to the lower
directory as lowerdir and the upper directory as a upperdir. The unified view
is exposed through its own directory called "merged".

The "image" layer is the "lowerdir" and the "container" layer is the
"upperdir". The unified view is exposed through a directory called "merged"
which is effectively the contaners mount point.

The "overlay" driver only works with two layers. This means that multi-layered
images cannot be implemented as multiple OverlayFS layers. Instead, each image
layer is implemented as its own directory under "/var/lib/docker/overlay".
Hard links are then used as a space-efficient way to reference data shared with
lower layers.

### Create container
To create a container, the "overlay" driver combines the directories
representing the image's top layer plus a new directory for the container. The
imageâ€™s top layer is the lowerdir in the overlay and is read-only. The new
directory for the container is the upperdir and is writable.

This example shows you how a newly built images contains 8 layers:

```bash
$ cat
/var/lib/docker/image/overlay/imagedb/content/sha256/7d8615604a7310835739e52f8566aaf6f70bbb889d76fc9f675479c501cc0307

```

Each image layer has its own directory within "/var/lib/docker/overlay/", which
contains its contents.
```bash
$ ls -l /var/lib/docker/overlay

Notice that the image layer IDs do not correspond to the directory IDs.
